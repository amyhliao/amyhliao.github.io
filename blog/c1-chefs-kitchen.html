      Shereef's video placed many things into perspective. My take on the DBC experience after watching the video is students will be immersed with coding knowledge by learning hands on and trying out codes on our own to see what we do and don't know. I see it as a collaborative effort, not only with the instructors, but with the students in the coforts. It is a journey that everyone will take together and help to pick people up when they fall or need help. I see DBC as a big family waiting to welcoming new members and make them more knowledgable coders.

        My impression of DBC is they are welcoming. They welcome the students in with open arms and excitment to start an educational trip with a new cohort of people. I see them as being a great support system when we face road blocks and they will act as a guide to ensure to clear that block ourselves. Even with all this in mind, I know that there will be times where deadlines will need to be met on projects and the stress level spikes, but I feel that the people in DBC have at hand wonderful programs to help with those situations.

        The culture of DBC is very engaging and it does make me a little nervous because of my lack of knowledge in this field. I am a little nervous that I will not be able to keep up with the topics and lessons or I will cannot contribute to discussions as much because I do not understand the material well enough. I know the learning environment will not be like one I have ever experience, but I am excited to be a part of it and to see how I do in it.
