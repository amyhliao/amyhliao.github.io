    <h3>What is Rails?</h3>
    <p>
      Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language created by a man named David Heinemeier Hansson. Rails is also a framework for building websites that establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (the web browser is the “front end”).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks.
    </p>
    <h3>The Principles of Rails</h3>
    <p>
      A few important philosophies or guiding principles of Rails are listed below.
    </p>
    <h3>Rails is Opinionated</h3>
    <p>
      Rails is said to be “opinionated.” There is a “Rails way” for many of the problems that must be solved by a web application developer. If you follow the Rails conventions, you’ll have fewer decisions to make and you’ll find more of what you need is already built. The benefit is faster development, improved collaboration, and easier maintenance.
    </p>
    <h3>Rails is Omakase</h3>
    <p>
      Omakase is a Japanese phrase that means “I’ll leave it to you.” Understanding that Rails is omakase means accepting that many of the opinions enshrined in the Rails API are the decisions of a Benevolent Dictator for Life, informed by discussion with other developers who have made significant contributions to the Rails code base. For the most part, Heinemeier Hansson’s “opinions” will serve you well.
    </p>
    <h3>Convention Over Configuration</h3>
    <p>
      “Convention over configuration” is an example of Rails as “opinionated software.” It is an extension of the concept of a default, a setting or value automatically assigned without user intervention. This will mean good productivity and less time spent setting up configuration files. Less time will be spent thinking about where things go and what names to assign. Because other developers have learned the same conventions as well, it is easier to collaborate.
    </p>
    <h3>Don’t Repeat Yourself</h3>
    <p>
      Known by the acronym DRY, “Don’t Repeat Yourself” is a principle of software development formulated as a way to avoid duplication. When code is duplicated, an application becomes more complex, making it more difficult to maintain and more vulnerable to unintentional bugs. The DRY principle can be extended to development processes as well as code. For example, manual testing is repetititive, but automated testing is DRY.
