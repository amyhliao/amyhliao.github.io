  <h2>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h2>

    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      The first week learning JavaScript felt like I was a child, learning to ride my bike without training wheels. Spending four weeks on Ruby felt like the training stage, learning to ride a bike with training wheels on. Once I became familiar with the concepts of Ruby and it’s language, JavaScript comes in and throws me off my Ruby game. Learning Javascript was a little easier, I’ll admit, because a lot of syntax is similar to Ruby. It’ll still be challenging to understand JS, don’t get me wrong, but starting with Ruby helped to pave the way for JS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning JS this week was pretty challenging. I read the required text carefully, ensuring I understand every function and example described in the readings. So far, the basics seem to be similar to the ones in Ruby, but we’ll see how different it is as we progress through JS.
    </p>
    <h3>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects </h3>
    <p>
      Javascript objects are data structures consisting of properties. You can create simple objects and write to properties like the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src = "../imgs/javascript.png" alt = "JavaScript">
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src = "../imgs/javascript2.png" alt = "JavaScript">
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src = "../imgs/javascript3.png" alt = "JavaScript">
    </p>
    <p>
      JS objects appear like simple dictionaries, a repository of properties that reference other objects and you can access these properties directly on the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where a JS object is a collection of properties that reference other objects, a ruby object contains a hash of instance variables that reference other objects. You can not access these instance variables in the same way that you can access (read or write to) JS properties. Ruby enforces a level of data encapsulation which protects these variables. Only when you are within the context of an object, which occurs during a method call, you can create or alter instance variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects are similar to Ruby’s hash, declared as variables, are a way of organizing key/value pairs. For example, var cat = {color: "grey", name: "Spot", age: "12"}; To access the value of an associated key, you can call that on the variable name: cat.name returns "Spot". You can also easily delete a key/value pair by writing delete cat.name. To declare a new key/value pair, write: cat.gender = "male";.
