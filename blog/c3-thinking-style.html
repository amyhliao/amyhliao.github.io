  <h2>Thinking Style</h2>

      After taking Gregorc's Thinking Style quiz, I realized I am an Abstract Random thinker. What does this mean? Well, according to some research done, an Abstract Random (AR) learner likes to listen to others while establishing relationships, focus on issues at hand, and bring harmony to group situations. AR thinkers learn best when they are in a personalized environment, given general guidenlines, maintain friendly relationships, and participate in group activities. Some things that AR learners may find difficult is competition, the need to justify feelings, working with authoritative or unfriendly personalities, and accepting positive positive criticisim.
    </p>
    Based on this research, I realized that I should be working in a supportive, friendly, and non-authoirative environment. This is helpful because now I know that I thrive during our guided pairing session as well as out peer pairing sessions. If the envirionment is friendly and comfortable, I will be able to learn new concepts with easy by reviewing it with a gorup or a pair.
    <p>
    Learning that my Thinking Style is Abstract Random has made me realize certain struggles during the Phase 0 course. Not knowing how the environment was at the beginning made me insercure to reach out to people for help. I was not able to pick other's brains about their strategies and how they worked through a challenge. As I dove further into Phase 0 and was required to work with other, I slowly got to know a few people and started to feel a little more comfortable to ask for help. It is still a little difficult to be sercure with working with strangers, but I believe once I meet everyone in person, I will be more sercure about working with everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ways that can help expand the way I learn and think is to embrace challenges no matter how difficult they can be. When working a new challenge, I will stay strong and persistant to complete the cahllenge because in the end, when it is all done, I will have learned a great deal than if I did not complete the challenge and gave up instead. The hard work on those challenges will shape me to become more succeptible to learning and learn from my criticisms.
