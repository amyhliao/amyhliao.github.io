  <h2>Tech Issues: Online Security</h2>
  <h4>Monday, August 3, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      In the recent months, many companies and corporations have faced hacking issues that caused serious damage to the comapnies name and leaked valuable information to the public. Sony was the most well known of their tech issues and the hacking saga they dealt with in November  2014. Valuable information of the company was taken from the company and everything else was wiped clean from their mainframe by the hackers. Some information that was stolen and later leaked were movies pending to be released, medical records of Sony employees, email chains amongst memebers of Sony, and so on.

      More recent cyberattacks have put airlines and the stores to halt. After the cyberattacks from Sony, companies have taken precautions and are becoming more aware of the serious effects of hacking. Since most corporations rely on massive computer system, a cyberattack can be likely, especially after the Sony hacking saga.

      Because of all the recent hacks, the topic of online security has come up in Congress. The tech industry is trying to lobby for net neutrality, a concept that Internet providers should enable access to all content equally regardless of the source. This hot topic has been of debate between Democrats and Repulicans and are still being considered to this day.
