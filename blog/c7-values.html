    <h3>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h3>
    <p>
      Growing up in a world where most people strive to be successful can create a competitive feel between everyone. Who I am as a person and what my values are has shaped me to part of that competitive world. My values will guide me through this journey, advising me what I should or should not do, and force me to push my boundaries to achieve whatever it is that I set my mind to.
    </p>
    <h3>Top 10 values</h3>
    <p>
      Here are my top 10 values and if I try to live up to them from a range of 1 to 5, with 5 being agree:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accomplishment: 5</li>
        <li>Adventure: 3</li>
        <li>Confidence: 4</li>
        <li>Excitement: 5</li>
        <li>Inspiration: 4</li>
        <li>Integrity: 4</li>
        <li>Courage: 4</li>
        <li>Knowledge: 4</li>
        <li>Close relationship: 5</li>
        <li>Loyalty: 5</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>The value of Integrity</h3>
    <p>
      Integrity is something I value because it keeps me true to myself and the type of person I want to be. There are lots of pressures in the world that will try to sway you from your judgment that makes you true. Having this value will keep me grounded and focused on how I was to achieve my accomplishments. This value will also dispel anyone who tries to steer my focus away from my beliefs.
    </p>
    <h3>A Penny For Your Thought?</h3>
    <p>
      A friend of mine was given an incredible opportunity to start a new job, but it would be in a new city far from home.  She asked for my advice on whether should take the job and move. I asked her if she was passionate about that job and if it was something she wanted to do. She said it was a job she would love to do, but that would mean leaving all familiar faces and things behind. I advised her to be courageous and to take the job. It’s too great of an opportunity to let it go and if the fear of leaving the familiar and comfortable were the only thing holding her back, all she needed to do was have the confidence to know that she will make new friends and get use to her new surrounding sin time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courage and confidence are two values I find important. Without it I feel like you can’t grow as a human being. One needs to be confident in them to know they want to grow and try new things. Being timid and scared will keep people in their own bubble fearing what is out in the unknown. Confidence and courage will help to break on from their bubble and open their eyes to new possibilities. All they need to do is take that initial step, make that one realization to do something new and different.
    </p>
    <h3>Stereotype Threats and its Effects</h3>
    <p>
      Applying my values should help mediate stereotype threats when I recognizing the feeling. A lot of it will probably be mental and being self-assured those stereotypes do not define who I am. Being confident and true to myself will hopefully ease those stereotype threats and extinguish any pressures I feel of meeting the stereotypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exercise to help ease the stereotype threats is acknowledging the threat and possibly talking about how the stereotype threat can make someone feel. Letting the other person know how those stereotypes can make you feel could possibly help them understand the effects of it. Getting to know the person would be a great way to see pass the stereotypes and truly know the person for who they are.
