    <h3>Conflicts at the Workplace</h3>
    <p>
      Working with different personalities in a tense work environment are grounds for conflicts to form. My first full-time job was exactly this setting. A time I faced a conflict was during my first job after obtaining my undergraduate degree. I was part of a team of about twenty people where we would clear up back logged accounts to ensure everything is up to date. This particular co-worker had just moved to the team I was on and had done her rounds of training. After her training was done, all of the team member’s work was re-divided equally to have her included in the workload.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coincidentally, she received my old accounts to review. When we review accounts, we consult with attorneys and law firms to give legal advice on how to proceed with those accounts. The counsel on my previous account was asking her on how to proceed and she did not know how to answer so she referred the counsel to consult with me. I already had my hands full on new accounts I obtained and could not assist. She kept pushing my old accounts back onto me even though they were no longer mine and she was not taking the responsibility of those accounts. In the end, I was taking on double the work, while she was not doing anything.
    </p>
    <h3>Source of Conflict and Emotions</h3>
    <p>
      The source of the conflict was my frustration of being pushed around by my team member and being overwhelmed with work. I felt used and disrespected by her because she thought it was ok for her to throw all her work on me. I became angry and frustrated on the job because she was throwing all her work onto me and getting away with it. I was also angry with myself for letting go on for as long as it did. I knew I had to speak up because it was making my work environment difficult.
    </p>
    <h3>Resolution to the Conflict</h3>
    <p>
      When I felt like I was being taken advantage of and could not be pushed around anymore, I talked to my team member privately about the conflict to see if she could take her workload back. She did not take it well and we ended up getting in a disagreement about our work ethics. She still did not think she was doing anything wrong and continued to push her work to me. I knew since talking to her personally did not resolve the conflict, I had to talk to management about the problem to see if they can help resolve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our unsuccessful talk, I approached the management team to discuss the situation at hand. They worked with us to resolve the conflict through mediated talks. In the end, with the help of my managers, my co-worker realized she was throwing all her work on me and took all her accounts back.
    </p>
    <h3>Looking Back and Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
      After going through this experience, I learned there would be different personalities and work ethics in any office you work in. You need to adapt and understand that some people work differently than you. In my case, I learned I also needed to stand my ground and not get pushed around. I need to be more confident in myself to stick up for what I believe. There will be people in the workplace who will think differently compared to you and that should not deter you from your work and ethics. I became a tougher person after that conflict and learned how to better deal with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back now, I wish I had stood up for myself earlier than I did. I let it go on too long and I think that make my co-worker get comfortable with pushing her work onto me. I think if I approached her sooner, I would not have had to bring the managers into the conflict. If I took a stand sooner, it may not have escalated to what it had become.
