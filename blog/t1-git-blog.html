      There are so many interesting concepts in the world of a developer. As a beginner, you are barely scrathcing the surface. I will introduce only a few concepts here today. The first concept will be version control and what that is. The next topic will be how git tracks changes. Finally, the last concept I will talk about are the benefits of GitHub in regards to storing code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control is an important concept to have. It basically keeps track of changes developers made to a file. Version control also allows a developer to save multiple versions of a project. This is important because if a project consists of hundreds of developers working on the same codes, version control will allow all of them to work on the same codes without saving over others work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracking and adding changes help with a developer by allowing one to see the changes done on the code and what those changes were specifically changed to. A developer can also access those changes made prior by another user to see what was added/edited. Instead of restarting a new code, developers can add changes to the code to better or update it.A way of tracking those changes is by inputting "git log" into the command line of the git file.
    </p>
      GitHub is a remote hub located on the internet where codes can be shared and projects to be collaborated at the same time. Users can upload their code by pushing them to GitHub where others can use and share those codes. GitHub is a great resource to use when storing code because not only is it one of the more populate resources to be used to store codes, but it is extremely easy to use and works well alongside Git.
