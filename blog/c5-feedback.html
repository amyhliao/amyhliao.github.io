  <h2>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>
  <h4>Sunday, August 8, 2015</h4>

    <h4>Pairing:</h4>
    <p>
      Pairing with others on certain challenges has been a large part of my learning process. It allows me to see how others operate and their thought process when trying to solve the challenges. It’s usually not what my first thought would be in approaching to solve the challenge, so it’s nice to see it in another perspective. This is a great opportunity to learn another way to solve the challenge and see another approach to the solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always fun and rewarding when you have a great connection and chemistry with your pair that makes the atmosphere light and fun. It of course is always rewarding to know that you have solved the challenge and everything runs exactly how you want it to. Pairing is also a great opportunity to meet your fellow cohort mates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most frustrating part of pairing would be not understanding the challenge or being able to solve it. The extensive research that usually comes with not being able to figure it out can be exhausting and extremely frustrating. Sometimes understanding how the other pair communicates can be a bit of an adjustment as well.
    </p>
    <h4>Feedback:</h4>
    <p>
      I like the feedback I receive and I feel it is helpful to help me improve in my pairing sessions. Reading the feedback I get from my pairs is extremely helpful. It tells me what I need to work on during future pairing sessions. The feedback I get also reassures me the things I’m doing right and what the pairs I worked with likes about working with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of the feedback I received advised that I should be more confident in my coding. I definitely try to be more confident, but I always second-guess myself. I personally find it difficult to gain confidence right away and it would definitely only grow after I get more familiar with the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, writing feedbacks was a little difficult and it required a lot to review before giving the feedback. As I got familiar with what to look for during the feedback, it got a little easier to provide feedback to my pairs regarding our sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think doing pairing sessions and providing feedback has been a huge help it my learning process because it gives me a whole new perspective on how to take on the challenge. Pairing also helps me understand certain concepts I am unfamiliar with and do not understand. My pairs are so helpful in clarifying things I don’t understand and they always give me great tips on what links to use to better understand some materials. The feedback portion allows me to work on my pairing skills and see what my pairs think of me.
