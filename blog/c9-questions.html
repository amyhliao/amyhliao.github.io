    <h3>It's All in the Title</h3>
    <p>
      Posting questions in the Google Community can be very nerve-wrecking at first, especially when it's to people you barely know. It may be scary at first, but it is an important factor to get past because posting your questions online can help you to resolve those issues you were having earlier. Asking questions is always important and here are some tricks to specify the questions so that could help clarify the results given by the respondents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Posting questions online from my own personal experience can be frustrating at times. Sometimes you don't get responses back, or when you do, they're not answering the question you asked originally. Sometimes, clarify your question and making it detailed can help to narrow down the broad answers that could be given my respndents. An important factor in asking the perfect question is to have a title that specifically states the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summarizing the specific problem in the title can also help to calrify what it is you are asking for help on. Some resources suggest to even state the actual question in the title and elaborate more after the title instead. Looking back at the questions I asked, I was never too clear or specific in my title which did lead to a lot of follow-up questions from the respondents before they gave their definitive answer. To save yourself from all the back and forth, be specific and include the question in the title.
    </p>
    <h3>So, What's Your Problem?</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have a clear definitive title that depicts your question you want to ask, you want to elaborate on the sepcifics of your problem in the body of the question so the respondents can hone in on the details. Usually, this is where you want to include your summary and include detailed description of the question you asked in the title. EYou also want to explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself. Once that is done, paste your samp;e code in body of question so the respondents have a visual of what your asking. Be sure to also include all tags your question relates to so it does not cause any confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the previous questions I've asked online, I did not provide a detailed summary and description of what I did to result to the confusion. I often pasted my sample code though, but if I had included the detailed summary, it would have helped the respondents understand my thought process before providing me their sample code.
    </p>
    <h3>Check, and Double-Check</h3>
    <p>
      With a specific question in the title, a detailed description and summary in the body of the question, and a copy of your sample code included, the next thing is to proofread and check for spelling and grammar before submitting the quesiton. It is important to ensure the question is clear, concise, and easy to follow. If the question is riddled with errors and typos, it makes it difficult for the answerers to provide you with their best response. Ensure your question is as effective as possible and that it makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, I barely proof-read the questions I posted. I was in too much of a haste to get it online so I could get a resolution to solve my issues. That ended up back-firing on me because my questions were not always concise and sometimes it didn't make sense. I started to get into the habit of proof-reading everything I write to ensure I'm being as clear as possible in an understandable manner.
