  <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>

      Stereotype threat is referring to being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one’s group. I am an Asian American woman and growing up in a society where stereotypes are all around you, I quickly grew up to know some of the main stereotypes associated with being asain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The times where I felt the effects of stereotype threat was mainly at school. The pressure that asians are known to be overachievers and ace every subject put a great deal of pressure on me and amongst other asain students.  Granted, the stereotype can be seen as a positive stereotype, but the threat that failure is not an option became overwhelming and at times is the only thought entering my mind.  Never knowing the feeling of not having the pressure to succeed being lifted, I tried to excel in everything. I was in honors classes, advanced placement classes, sports, art, and music classes to become a “well rounded” asian American. It was difficult to juggle and succeed in all those courses without feeling the weight of failure pulling me down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having this stereotype threat put a great deal of stress on me throughout my whole life. Needing to do well in everything I do without thought that failing in something is ok made me uptight, pressured, and stressed. The pressures, along with the stress, cause me to not perform well in the eyes of the stereotypes. Knowing how important the tests I took were and how they would shape my future and the expectations of the stereotype to doing extremely well almost broke me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another misconception asian receive, especially women, is that they are terrible drivers. Well, the idea of this effects me every time I drive in an unfamiliar place. I get nervous if I do something slightly irregular on the road, bystanders and other drivers will assume that I am a horrible driver because I am asian. Because of that thought, I was always anxious about driving to unfamiliar places. As I got more experience driving through the years, I became a little more comfortable with the idea and tried not to let the stereotype bother me. It still effects me somewhat, but not as much as it use to.
