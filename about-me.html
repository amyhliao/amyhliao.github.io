            My name is Amy Liao. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California for most of my life, before deciding to sunny San Diego to puruse my undergraduate degree in Jounalism and Media Studies at San Diego State University.
        </p>

         <p class="body">
             After fnishing obtaining my undergraduate degree, I was lost and did not know what I wanted to do in life. I did meaningless jobs I didn't have a pssion for and never tapped into my creative mindset. Finally, after extensive research and soul-searching, I realized I needed to start fresh in a career I know I'll love and one that will always challenge me. Enter DevBootcamp...
         </p>

         <p class="body">
             After hearing much about the program and researching about the tech industry, my close friend urged me to pursure this passion I have to create. With no experience in this industry at all, I was very timid to apply. It wasn't until I heard my boss tell me that I am a valuable member of the team and I should never leave them that made me realize I did not want to stay at a dead end job I hated. So I went through the process of applying, studied as much as I could on my own, and left my job.
         </p>

         <p class="body">
             Now, months later, I am estatic about my decision even with the doubts and uncertainties that come with it. I know I am bettering myself by learning something I have so much passion for.
