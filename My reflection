## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Add my reflection

To create a new repository, go to GitHub to complete a new repository form where you can create a repository name and set the account accordingly. To clone the repository, the HTML link fro GitHub is copied and entered into git by using "git clone 'HTML link'".

Open source allows the programs to be shared to the pulblic who can then cusomize them to their liking.

The concept of Open Source is a little intimidating because you and the information you put are exposed to the public.I would be a little nervous to put my work out to the world, but would feel much more at ease if I got some options from my peers that I trust first.

The purpose of using license is so important because it will allow others to see a developers work and assist in matters that may help that developer improve. It allows any software to be adjusted, used, and shared freely by everyone.

The concept for this challenge was pretty straight forward. We were to start our own website by creating a new repository. The concept of licensing and open source was also eye-opening. I never imagined so much went into a concept that I always believed should be shared with everyone. The biggest struggle I had in this challenge was ensuring that I cloned the correct HTML to Git.

So far, I have not found any additional outside information to assist in helping me better understand the topic at hand.
